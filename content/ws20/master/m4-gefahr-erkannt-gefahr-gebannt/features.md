{{<section title="Interaction with self modeled machines">}}
As our target group are trainees we aimed to flatten the learning curve and provide anchors of recognition by modeling the exact machines they are learning to operate.
One of the challenges hereby was to adapt machine operation to the VR medium while staying true to the mechanics of the real machines.

{{<section title="Bench Drill">}}
The bench drill is the most complex (and dangerous!) of all the machines we modeled.
Users must follow the correct sequence of operational steps to stay safe, or risk serious injury.
Interactions include adjusting of drill bits, the fastening of a workpiece in the operational vice, toggling a light and turning the machine on and off.

{{<section title="Hand lever shear">}}
Our hand lever shear is used to cut smaller pieces and strips of metal.
This machine provides a higher level of accuracy and a more convenient operation than the guillotine shears.
To operate it users must unhinge the safety hook and pull the lever down, executing the cutting movement of the blade.

{{<section title="Guillotine shear">}}
The guillotine shear is used to cut larger sheets of metal down to size. To do so, a sheet is layed on the operating surface and positioned under the blade.
The shear is activated via a switch on the box on the left side. Once activated, the blade is pushed down, separating excess material from the work piece.

{{<section title="Glue Gun">}}
Another tool in our application is the glue gun. If you make use of it you are able to attach one object permanently to another. 
To fixate an object you have to take the glue gun, press the 'trigger' while shoving it above the preferred object and then stick it onto the other piece.

{{<section title="Injury simulation">}}
One of the core concepts of our project is to give an impression of how badly one can hurt themselves as a consequence of improper machine operation.
At the same time we do not want to scare the trainees away from using the machines they need for their work.
During user testing we received mixed opinions on the graphic detail shown - some thought they could be more detailed (gory), while others thought it might be overwhelming for sensitive users.
The head teacher of the metal workshop stressed that showing what is real is important - trainees should be aware of the severity of possible injuries.

{{<section title="Clipboard Feedback">}}
In case you used one of the machines the wrong way, the screen will fade out until it becomes black. 
Afterwards you will see a clipboard which tells you exactly what you did wrong and how you can do it right the next time using this machine.
