{{<section title="Visit to workshop">}}
Before this project neither one of us had any ideas what to expect. To get a plan about the work field we were provided for, we went into Zoom meetings with both the partners of AVT and BFW. 
They invited us to their workshops to gather enough information about the machines being used as well as the possibilities of injuries.

{{<section title="Research">}}
After the meeting we discussed and categorized our impressions.
We dived into a research phase to get an overview of safety applications already published in this field.
We found the [Lathe Safety Simulator VR](http://www.lathesafetysimulator.com/#about), which is...

Also we searched for papers and studies...

{{<section title="Implementation">}}
Having made our minds about which machines we wanted to apply, we entered the next phase: implementation.

We split our team into two groups: developers and modellers. While Marvin and Konrad took the real life examples and replicated the machines in blender, Julian and Adrian overtook the implementation of the necessary VR interactions and injury types.

Having just two VR headsets at hand and working in a complete remote setting, iterative developing skills where especially needed for optimizing the 3D models. After being modeled, numerous versions of the selected machines had to be tested in vr and improved uppon the feedback...

{{<section title="User Tests">}}
A big step in our development process was the chance to let potential users test our prototype. For this we went to the AVT workshop and, following the current safety and hygiene rules, the trainees gave our demo a go.

First we introduced our project to the group with a brief description of our motives. We explained how the whole application worked and those who agreed to being filmed and recorded for research and showtime purposes signed a declaration of consent.

Afterwards we started with individual testing. Seven users were testing for approx. 30 to 50 minutes per session. Our test persons had the chance to use the whole working area freely. Every few minutes they were given minor tasks, e.g. cropping metal sheets with the guillotine shear. 
Later we asked the individual test persons to reflect on their usage of the VR application. 

In the end we interviewed the whole group about their experiences, their possible wishes to us - as to what we could do better or different - including their opinion about the significance of our work.

At last we fixed some of the bugs we had noticed during testing and polished the prototype for our next big reveal: the Showtime!
